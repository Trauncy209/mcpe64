# TruancyCraftPE

TruancyCraftPE is a community restoration and expansion of **Minecraft: Pocket Edition 0.6.1 alpha**.

This project is about keeping the soul of old MCPE while pushing it forward on modern devices.

**Our philosophy:** this should be a **community-made Minecraft, not corporate slop**.

We want to preserve what made early Pocket Edition special, fix what was broken, and steadily build a better version of it in public.

## What we are building toward

Our long-term goal is not just to preserve 0.6.1, but to turn it into the best version of itself.

That means work toward:

- better graphics
- better terrain
- better NPCs / mobs / world behavior
- better controls
- better movement feel
- better camera / looking-around feel
- better UI and usability
- better multiplayer
- better controller support
- better performance
- better modding/restoration infrastructure
- continued bug fixing as we dig through this very old game

This is an old game, and a lot of the work is exactly what you would expect from reviving one:
**fix bugs, modernize carefully, keep the feel, repeat**.

---

## Project goals

TruancyCraftPE exists to:

- preserve the original 0.6.1 alpha experience
- keep classic worlds playable and recognizable
- add optional improvements without forcing the game to lose its identity
- make the game work well on modern Android devices and modern systems
- improve multiplayer and LAN support
- expand world generation while still allowing classic behavior
- give the community a real place to collaborate on old MCPE restoration

## Building

### Android build

The current Android build flow uses `build.sh`.

Example full build:

```bash
ANDROID_SDK_ROOT=/home/Alkaline/Android/Sdk \
ANDROID_NDK_PATH=/home/Alkaline/Android/Sdk/ndk/26.1.10909125 \
ADB=/usr/bin/true \
bash ./build.sh --abi arm64-v8a
```

Useful variants:

```bash
# skip Java rebuild
bash ./build.sh --abi arm64-v8a --no-java

# skip C++ rebuild
bash ./build.sh --abi arm64-v8a --no-cpp

# package only
bash ./build.sh --abi arm64-v8a --no-java --no-cpp
```

### Important packaging note

On this project, the Android `d8` / `r8` step can crash on:

- `build-apk/classes/com/mojang/minecraftpe/MainActivity$1.class`

If that happens, the current working fallback is:

```bash
/home/Alkaline/Android/Sdk/build-tools/30.0.3/dx \
  --dex --output=build-apk/classes.dex build-apk/classes

ANDROID_SDK_ROOT=/home/Alkaline/Android/Sdk \
ANDROID_NDK_PATH=/home/Alkaline/Android/Sdk/ndk/26.1.10909125 \
ADB=/usr/bin/true \
bash ./build.sh --abi arm64-v8a --no-java --no-cpp
```
